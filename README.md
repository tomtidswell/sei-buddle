# Buddle.
a General Assembly group roject by Sim, Sheema and Tom.

A full-stack social app to find and host events. Are you looking for a playdate for your pet, an additional player for your five a side booking, or someone to go to a museum with? If you are, Buddle is the event app for you. The app uses a MERN stack, uses multiple REST routes, and allows secure signup and login.

This was a group project so all the work you see documented here for the [first version](#v1) of this app was created in one week by all three [contributors](#contributors). I worked alone on a subsequent version on an ad-hoc basis over the following month.

## Built With

* **Front-end**
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [react-burger-menu](https://github.com/negomi/react-burger-menu) - giving the site navigation a boost

* **Back-end**
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - for helping with the routes
  * [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - object modelling
  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - database

## Key Functionality

I'm very proud of the capability and user experience we managed to pack into this project. Some of the key features are:

* Category and sub-category filtering
* Secure user updates

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, you will need to follow these steps. Later I will follow this up with notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

I have been using yarn as my package manager, and so all the steps below are using that, but npm can also be used.

### Installing

1. Initiate the project and install the dependencies:

```
yarn
```

2. Seed the database:

```
yarn seed
```

3. Launch the back-end:

```
yarn serve:back
```

4. Keep that terminal session running and create a new one (on a Mac: cmd + t) then launch the front-end:

```
yarn serve:front
```
It's now ready to access on the [localhost](https://localhost:8000).
